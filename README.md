Part of the curriculum of Cal Poly's Master's of Science in Quantitative Economics. Completed Fall 2021.

## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to computer programming using Python.
Although the course will be taught using Python, an emphasis will be placed
on general rules and best practices for programming that are applicable to
many programming languages. The first part of the course will cover general programming concepts including data structures, 
flow control, functions,
object-oriented programming, and debugging. The second part of the course
will apply this general programming knowledge to solve problems in data
science and econometrics including data wrangling, web scraping, database
querying, model selection and cross validation, and implementing selected
machine learning methods.
